# Types of queues

- In Linux, there are several types of queues used for inter-process communication (IPC) and task scheduling. Here are the main types of queues in the Linux operating system:

## 1. **Message Queues**
Message queues allow processes to communicate by sending and receiving messages in a structured format.

- **Types**:
  - **System V Message Queues**: Traditional IPC mechanism in Unix/Linux, allowing processes to send and receive messages in a queue.
    - **Functions**: 
      - `msgget()`: Create or access a message queue.
      - `msgsnd()`: Send a message to the queue.
      - `msgrcv()`: Receive a message from the queue.
      - `msgctl()`: Control operations on the message queue.
  
  - **POSIX Message Queues**: Standardized message queue API in POSIX-compliant systems, allowing for enhanced functionality and portability.
    - **Functions**:
      - `mq_open()`: Create or open a message queue.
      - `mq_send()`: Send a message to the queue.
      - `mq_receive()`: Receive a message from the queue.
      - `mq_close()`: Close a message queue.

## 2. **Job Queues**
Job queues are used by the Linux kernel to manage processes waiting for CPU time.

- **Example**:
  - **Process Scheduling Queue**: The kernel maintains various queues for scheduling processes, including:
    - **Ready Queue**: Contains processes that are ready to run but waiting for CPU allocation.
    - **Blocked Queue**: Contains processes that are waiting for some event to occur (like I/O completion).

## 3. **Task Queues**
Task queues are used in the Linux kernel for managing work that needs to be executed in the context of kernel threads.

- **Example**:
  - **Work Queues**: Used to defer work to be processed later in the context of kernel threads, allowing for parallel execution of tasks without blocking the current process.

## 4. **Run Queue**
The run queue is a crucial part of the Linux kernel's process scheduler. It contains all the runnable processes (tasks) that are ready to be executed.

- **Structure**: Each CPU has its own run queue, which helps in load balancing across multiple processors.

## 5. **Network Queues**
Linux also utilizes queues for managing network packets.

- **Types**:
  - **Socket Buffers**: Queues used by the networking stack to hold incoming and outgoing packets.
  - **Transmit Queues**: Queues that hold packets waiting to be sent out over a network interface.

## 6. **Pipe and FIFO Queues**
Pipes and FIFOs (named pipes) are IPC mechanisms that allow data to be passed between processes.

- **Example**:
  - **Pipes**: Used for communication between related processes. They operate in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) manner.
  - **FIFOs**: Similar to pipes but can be used for communication between any processes, not just related ones.

## 7. **Kernel Message Queue**
The kernel maintains its own message queue for logging messages.

- **Example**:
  - **dmesg Queue**: Stores kernel messages, which can be viewed using the `dmesg` command. This queue is essential for debugging and monitoring kernel behavior.

### Summary
These various types of queues in the Linux operating system serve different purposes, from facilitating inter-process communication to managing tasks and scheduling.
Understanding these queues is crucial for developers working on system-level programming, performance tuning, and optimizing resource usage in Linux.
