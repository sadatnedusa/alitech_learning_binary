# Understanding the Difference Between XOR and OR Bitwise Operators

## The bitwise XOR (`^`) and OR (`|`) operators are both used to manipulate binary numbers at the bit level, but they operate differently. 
### Let's explore their differences with detailed explanations and examples.

## Points to Ponder

Understanding the difference between the XOR and OR bitwise operators is crucial for various programming tasks that involve binary data manipulation. The key distinction is that OR sets a bit to 1 if any of the corresponding bits are 1, while XOR sets a bit to 1 only if the corresponding bits are different.


#### Bitwise OR (`|`)

**Operation**: The bitwise OR operator compares each bit of two numbers. If at least one of the bits is 1, the resulting bit is set to 1. Otherwise, it is set to 0.

**Example**:
```
  A = 5  ->  0101
  B = 3  ->  0011
  ------------
A | B ->  0111 (7 in decimal)
```

**Explanation**:
- Compare each bit of A and B:
  - The leftmost bit: 0 | 0 = 0
  - The second bit from the left: 1 | 0 = 1
  - The third bit from the left: 0 | 1 = 1
  - The rightmost bit: 1 | 1 = 1
- The resulting binary number is 0111, which is 7 in decimal.

#### Bitwise XOR (`^`)

**Operation**: The bitwise XOR operator compares each bit of two numbers. If the bits are different, the resulting bit is set to 1. If they are the same, the resulting bit is set to 0.

**Example**:
```
  A = 5  ->  0101
  B = 3  ->  0011
  ------------
A ^ B ->  0110 (6 in decimal)
```

**Explanation**:
- Compare each bit of A and B:
  - The leftmost bit: 0 ^ 0 = 0
  - The second bit from the left: 1 ^ 0 = 1
  - The third bit from the left: 0 ^ 1 = 1
  - The rightmost bit: 1 ^ 1 = 0
- The resulting binary number is 0110, which is 6 in decimal.

#### Summary of Differences

- **Bitwise OR (`|`)**: Produces a 1 if **at least one** of the corresponding bits of the operands is 1.
- **Bitwise XOR (`^`)**: Produces a 1 if **only one** of the corresponding bits of the operands is 1 (i.e., the bits are different).

### Additional Examples

Let's look at more examples to further illustrate the differences between XOR and OR:

**Example 1:**
```
  A = 6  ->  0110
  B = 4  ->  0100
  ------------
A | B ->  0110 (6 in decimal)
A ^ B ->  0010 (2 in decimal)
```

**Example 2:**
```
  A = 7  ->  0111
  B = 8  ->  1000
  ------------
A | B ->  1111 (15 in decimal)
A ^ B ->  1111 (15 in decimal)
```

**Example 3:**
```
  A = 12  ->  1100
  B = 10  ->  1010
  ------------
A | B ->  1110 (14 in decimal)
A ^ B ->  0110 (6 in decimal)
```

### Pseudocode for Bitwise OR and XOR

Here are the pseudocodes for performing bitwise OR and XOR operations:

**Pseudocode for Bitwise OR (`|`)**:
```pseudo
function bitwiseOR(a, b):
    result = 0
    position = 1
    while a > 0 or b > 0:
        if (a & 1) == 1 or (b & 1) == 1:
            result += position
        a = a >> 1
        b = b >> 1
        position = position << 1
    return result
```

**Pseudocode for Bitwise XOR (`^`)**:
```pseudo
function bitwiseXOR(a, b):
    result = 0
    position = 1
    while a > 0 or b > 0:
        if (a & 1) != (b & 1):
            result += position
        a = a >> 1
        b = b >> 1
        position = position << 1
    return result
```
