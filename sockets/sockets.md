# What is a Socket?
- A socket is an endpoint for sending or receiving data across a computer network. It acts as a bridge between an application and the underlying transport layer protocols, such as TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol).

- Sockets are a fundamental technology for network communication in Linux and other operating systems. They provide a way for applications to communicate over a network, either between processes on the same machine (inter-process communication) or across different machines (network communication). This explanation will cover the basics of sockets, different types of sockets, how to create and use them, and advanced topics.

## Key Concepts

1. **IP Address**: A unique address assigned to each device on a network.
2. **Port Number**: A number that identifies a specific process or service on a device. Common port numbers include 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS.
3. **Protocol**: The set of rules that govern how data is transmitted over the network. The two most common protocols used with sockets are:
   - **TCP**: Connection-oriented, reliable, and ensures data delivery.
   - **UDP**: Connectionless, faster, but does not guarantee data delivery.

## Types of Sockets

1. **Stream Sockets (TCP Sockets)**: 
   - Use TCP as the transport layer protocol.
   - Provide reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data.
   - Use the following functions:
     - `socket()`: Create a new socket.
     - `bind()`: Bind the socket to an IP address and port.
     - `listen()`: Listen for incoming connections.
     - `accept()`: Accept a connection from a client.
     - `connect()`: Connect to a server.
     - `send()`: Send data.
     - `recv()`: Receive data.

2. **Datagram Sockets (UDP Sockets)**:
   - Use UDP as the transport layer protocol.
   - Provide a connectionless communication model.
   - Functions used are similar, but `sendto()` and `recvfrom()` are used instead of `send()` and `recv()`.
  
## Creating and Using Sockets in C

### Step 1: Creating a Socket

Here’s a simple example of creating a TCP socket in C.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <arpa/inet.h>

int main() {
    int sockfd;
    struct sockaddr_in server_addr;

    // Create a socket
    sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
    if (sockfd < 0) {
        perror("socket creation failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    printf("Socket created successfully\n");

    // Define the server address
    server_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
    server_addr.sin_port = htons(8080); // Convert to network byte order
    server_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY; // Accept any incoming address

    // Bind the socket
    if (bind(sockfd, (struct sockaddr*)&server_addr, sizeof(server_addr)) < 0) {
        perror("bind failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    printf("Socket bound successfully\n");

    // Listen for incoming connections
    if (listen(sockfd, 5) < 0) {
        perror("listen failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    printf("Listening for incoming connections...\n");

    // Accept a connection
    int new_socket;
    struct sockaddr_in client_addr;
    socklen_t addr_len = sizeof(client_addr);
    new_socket = accept(sockfd, (struct sockaddr*)&client_addr, &addr_len);
    if (new_socket < 0) {
        perror("accept failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }
    printf("Connection accepted\n");

    // Close sockets
    close(new_socket);
    close(sockfd);
    return 0;
}
```

### Step 2: Sending and Receiving Data

To send and receive data using the created socket, you can modify the above example:

```c
// After accepting a connection
char buffer[1024] = {0};
int valread;

// Read data from the client
valread = read(new_socket, buffer, 1024);
printf("Received: %s\n", buffer);

// Send data back to the client
const char *message = "Hello from server!";
send(new_socket, message, strlen(message), 0);
```

### Step 3: Client-Side Code

Here’s a simple client code to connect to the server:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <arpa/inet.h>

int main() {
    int sockfd;
    struct sockaddr_in server_addr;

    // Create a socket
    sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
    if (sockfd < 0) {
        perror("socket creation failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    // Define the server address
    server_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
    server_addr.sin_port = htons(8080);
    server_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr("127.0.0.1"); // Localhost

    // Connect to the server
    if (connect(sockfd, (struct sockaddr*)&server_addr, sizeof(server_addr)) < 0) {
        perror("connection failed");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    // Send data to the server
    const char *message = "Hello from client!";
    send(sockfd, message, strlen(message), 0);
    printf("Message sent\n");

    // Receive data from the server
    char buffer[1024] = {0};
    int valread = read(sockfd, buffer, 1024);
    printf("Received from server: %s\n", buffer);

    // Close the socket
    close(sockfd);
    return 0;
}
```

### Advanced Socket Concepts

1. **Socket Options**: You can set various options for sockets using the `setsockopt()` function. Common options include:
   - `SO_REUSEADDR`: Allows the socket to bind to an address that is in a `TIME_WAIT` state.
   - `SO_KEEPALIVE`: Enables keepalive messages on a connected socket.

2. **Non-blocking Sockets**: You can make a socket non-blocking using `fcntl()`, which allows for asynchronous operations.

3. **Socket Select and Poll**: To handle multiple connections, you can use the `select()` or `poll()` functions to monitor multiple sockets simultaneously.

4. **Multicast Sockets**: For sending data to multiple recipients in one go, multicast sockets can be used, especially with UDP.

5. **Security Considerations**: Using sockets can expose your application to various security threats. Implement secure practices like validating inputs, using encryption (e.g., SSL/TLS), and employing firewalls.
